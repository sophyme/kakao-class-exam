      Life. Liberty. And the pursuit of entrepreneurship. It's awaking in the
      morning and pinching yourself black-and-blue-that OMG, this is my life,
      and it's freaking awesome. You live in your dream house, but there's no
      mortgage. No alarm clock. No boss. No bill. It's making more money before
      breakfast then you made for an entire week at your last job. a victorious
      symbol that your dreams no longer sleep in fantasies, but are awake with
      reality. Make no mistake, this life exists.
